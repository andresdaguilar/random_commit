# About this repository

This repository exists for a very specific reason.

It automatically generates a small number of commits at random intervals.
The goal is not productivity, features, or shipping code.

The goal is to highlight how misleading the GitHub “green grid” can be.

## Why?

The contribution graph is often interpreted as a proxy for:
- consistency
- discipline
- seniority
- impact

In reality, it mostly measures one thing:
**how often a commit is pushed to a public repository.**

You can be highly effective with few commits.
You can also generate commits with no real value.

This repo exists to make that point explicit.

## What this is (and is not)

✅ A reminder that metrics without context are shallow  
✅ A small automation experiment  
✅ A conversation starter  

❌ A measure of my real work  
❌ A substitute for experience or impact  
❌ An attempt to game the system secretly  

That’s why this repository is public and documented.

## What actually matters

If you’re evaluating my work, look at:
- problem-solving ability
- architectural decisions
- communication
- outcomes, not activity

The grid is green.
Reality is more nuanced.
